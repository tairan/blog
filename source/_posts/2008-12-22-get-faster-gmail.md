IE 7 又被鄙视了！

用IE 7 打开Gmail，在页面的右上角赫然的出现红色字体 Get faster Gmail！

点击这个链接进去后出现的页面是firefox3 和 chrome的下载推荐

Get faster Gmail with a faster browser
Browsers are getting faster and better at running web applications like Google Mail that use browser technology to its limits. In order to get the best experience possible and make Google Mail run an average of twice as fast, we suggest that you upgrade your browser to one of the fastest Google Mail supported browsers that work on Windows.

<strong>Note</strong>: A faster version of Internet Explorer, IE8, is in development and available in a beta release.
